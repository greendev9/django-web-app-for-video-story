Anything that you post or otherwise make available on Skigit is referred to as ‘User Content’. You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content that you post to Skigit.

Nothing in these Terms shall restrict other legal rights that Skigit may have to User Content, for example under other licences. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content, or change the way that it is used in the Service, for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms, our Community Guidelines or any other policies.

			To put it simply, you give Skigit permission to use your content in its mission to bring people the inspiration to create a life and make the Difference in the world we live in. This means that Skigit can display and play your  videos, and users can post and share those videos throughout the world.</p>

            <h3 class="sageo">d. How we rank content</h3></p>

			On Skigit, we show both only earned media content also known as Unpaid Organic content. The existence or absence of an advertising relationship with the content creator does not factor into our ranking decisions.</p>

			<p>

            <h3 class="sageo">10. Indemnity</h3></p> 
			<p>
			You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Skigit and our respective officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any claims, suits, proceedings, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees (including costs of defense of claims, suits or proceedings brought by third parties), in any way related to (a) your access to or use of our Service, (b) your User Content or (c) your breach of any of these Terms.<p>
			
			
			<p>
            <h3 class="sageo">11. Disclaimers</h3></p> 
			<p>
			Our Service and all content on Skigit is provided on an “as is” basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.

			SKIGIT SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

			Skigit takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other user or third party posts or sends using our Service. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children or otherwise unsuited to your purpose.<p>
			
			
			<p>
            <h3 class="sageo">12. Limitation of liability</h3></p> 
			<p>
			TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SKIGIT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES. IN NO EVENT SHALL SKIGIT’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SERVICE EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS (US $100.00) OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO SKIGIT FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS FOR THE SERVICE.<p>
			
			<p>
            <h3 class="sageo">13. Arbitration</h3></p> 
			<p>
			For any dispute you have with Skigit, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If we need to contact you, we will do so at the email address associated with your Business account. If Skigit has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms through binding arbitration or (for qualifying claims) in a small claims court.


			Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court. For instance, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited discovery and is subject to very limited review by courts. Although the process is more informal, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the US Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision and that you and Skigit are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Business account.


			Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (‘AAA’)
			under the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. You can find their forms at www.adr.org. Unless you and Skigit agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county (or parish) where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Skigit will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed US $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If your claim is for US $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA rules. If your claim exceeds US $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgement on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorised access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Skigit ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU. To the extent that any claim, dispute or controversy regarding Skigit or our Service isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and Skigit both agree that any claim or dispute regarding Skigit will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms.<p>
			
			
			<p>
            <h3 class="sageo">14. Governing law and jurisdiction</h3></p> 
			<p>
			These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is San Francisco County, California or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and our dispute will be determined under California law.

			If you’re in the EU, these Terms shall be governed by the laws of England. The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is London, England, and our dispute will be determined under English law.<p>
			
			<p>
            <h3 class="sageo">15. General terms</h3></p> 
			<p>
			<br>
			<p>
            <h3 class="sageo">Notification procedures and changes to these Terms </h3></p> 
			<p>
			Skigit reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose. We may revise these Terms from time to time, and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our discretion, is material, we will notify you.

			If you’re in the EU, we will notify you of revisions at least 15 days before those changes take effect. We don’t impose changes retroactively, so any change will be from its effective date forward.

			By continuing to access or use the Service after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.<p>
			<br>
			<p><h3 class="sageo">Assignment  </h3></p> 
			<p>
			These Terms, and any rights and licences granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Pinterest without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.<p>
			<br>
			<p><h3 class="sageo">Entire agreement/severability </h3></p> 
			<p>
			These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements that you may enter into with Pinterest in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Pinterest concerning the Service and supersede any prior terms that you have with Pinterest regarding the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.<p>
			<br>
			<p><h3 class="sageo">No waiver  </h3></p> 
			<p>
			No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Pinterest’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<p>
			<br>
			<p><h3 class="sageo">Parties </h3></p> 
			<p>
			If you live in North America or South America, these Terms are a contract between you and Pinterest Inc., 651 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. If you live outside of North America or South America, these Terms are a contract between you and Pinterest Europe Ltd., an Irish company with its registered office at Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.

		``US government agencies: if you are a United States federal government agency, your use of Pinterest is subject to these Terms and this amendment.

			US state and local government agencies: if you are a state or local government agency in the United States, this amendment applies to these Terms.

			Effective 14 August 2020<p>
